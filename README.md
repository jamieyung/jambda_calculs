# What is this?

    This is a personal experiment in building a compiler. It compiles lambda
    calculus expressions to Javascript.


# Building the compiler:

    make build

    This generates an executable file called jambda_calculus in the ./build
    directory.


# Running the compiler:

    Usage:

        jambda_calculus PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE

    Note: At the moment, both files must already exist.
